👋 Hello there! I'm Seán, a passionate developer and designer who loves crafting innovative solutions through code and creativity.

🌐 As a web developer, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, building interactive and user-friendly websites that leave a lasting impression. I strive to create interfaces that are not only visually appealing but also intuitive and enjoyable to use.

💻 With a strong background in C++, C, Python, and JavaScript, I tackle programming challenges with enthusiasm. From mastering the fundamentals to diving deep into object-oriented programming and data structures, I continuously expand my knowledge to write efficient and scalable code.

🤖 Additionally, I have a keen interest in AI and utilize my skills to create compelling and engaging content. Whether it's writing AI-driven articles or working on coding assignments, I enjoy exploring the intersection of technology and creativity.

🎨 When I'm not coding, you'll find me immersed in the world of design. Using tools like Figma, I bring ideas to life, ensuring that the user experience remains at the forefront of every design decision.

✨ Let's collaborate and build something amazing together! Feel free to explore my projects and reach out for exciting opportunities
